# How To Exchange And Ship Items With A PayPal Backed Swap, Buy, Or Sell
Use this document as guideline in performing safe / disputable transactions. PayPal invoicing is the best way to do this. At this time, Blossm will not be held responsible for any transactions that needs to be disputed (See [Disputes](#disputes) for more info). 
## Swap
1. Agree on Blossm messenger an amount you all will be invoicing each other on PayPal as collateral in case something goes wrong. The amount will usually be a price you deem would cover the cost of the items you are sending.
2. You will both request an invoice from each other via PayPal (Normally the same amount). Go to [Paypal Invoice](#invoice-via-paypal) for more details on how to do this.
3. Once you and the other person have paid the invoice it's time to ship your items, so exchange shipping addresses. Go to [Shipping](#tips-with-shipping) for more details on how to do this.
4. In case anything goes wrong, and you need to request your money back, go to [Disputes](#disputes).

## Buy
1. Agree on Blossm messenger an amount you will be paying plus shipping. You will also need to give the seller a shipping address.
2. Wait for an invoice from the seller for the agreed upon price plus shipping. This might come from a PayPal link or through your PayPal account.
3. Once paid wait for the seller to let you know the item is on its way!
4. In case anything goes wrong, and you need to request your money back, go to [Disputes](#disputes).

## Sell
1. Agree on Blossm messenger an amount you will accept for your item + shipping. You will also need to know the buyers shipping address.
2. You can now send a PayPal invoice to the buyer for the price + shipping. See [Paypal Invoice](#invoice-via-paypal).
3. Once the invoice has been paid, you now need to ship the item. See [Shipping](#tips-with-shipping).

## Tips with shipping
* If you need help on how to package a plant you can go here [How To Package Plants For Shipping](https://blossm.garden/how-to-package-plants/)
* Decide on your shipping method. At the moment, USPS may not be the most reliable method. UPS is good choice for domestic shipping. Typically, you both pick the same method, but that is up to you!
* 3-day air is a good option but expensive (~$50 bucks). UPS ground usually arrives on Friday, when shipped on Monday (~$12).
* Ship plants on either Monday or Tuesday to ensure they donâ€™t get stuck at the warehouse over the weekend.

## Disputes
1. Try to resolve the issue with the other user first.
2. If you all can't come to an agreement, and you used PayPal invoicing, go directly through [PayPal Disputes](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/security/buyer-protection-resolution) for your money back.
3. You can also use our rating system to let others know about your experience with a user.
